# Chat Server

The server is pretty simple, but is the heart of the system. It holds chat history and a list of writeable files, and can do the following:

* Add message and return the reply
  * with and without updating chat history
* Apply a file edit/deletion/creation
 
In the future:
* Fork the chat
* Change history
